# Final Project - AI-Enhanced Game Environment

Students will design and implement a game environment that integrates generative AI to create dynamic, engaging player experiences. The project should demonstrate the use of at least two different generative AI techniques covered in the course, such as LLMs for dialogue, procedural generation for levels or assets, or multimodal AI for interactive audio-visual elements. The final deliverable should include a playable game prototype, a technical presentation detailing the integration and optimization of AI models, and an ethical evaluation of the AI's impact on gameplay.

## Rubric

- **Technical Implementation (40%)**
   - Integration of AI Models (20%): Effective integration of at least two generative AI techniques. Models should be appropriately chosen and optimized for their respective tasks.
   - Functionality (20%): The game should be fully playable with AI components functioning as intended, enhancing gameplay and interactions.

- **Innovation and Creativity (20%)**
   - Originality (10%): Creative use of AI to provide unique and compelling gameplay experiences.
   - Design (10%): Aesthetic and functional design that leverages AI to enhance the game's visual and interactive elements.

- **Presentation (20%)**
   - Presentation (20%): Clear and engaging presentation of the game, highlighting AI features and their impact on player experience. Comprehensive explanation of the AI integration process, including model selection, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

- **Ethical Considerations (10%)**
   - Ethical Analysis (10%): Evaluation of potential biases, ethical implications, and societal impacts of the AI components used in the game. Proposals for mitigating identified risks.

- **Collaboration and Effort (10%)**
   - Teamwork (10%): Effective collaboration among team members, with roles and contributions clearly defined. Measured by peer feedback.

Teams will be 2-4 students, depending on class size. The final presentations will be held on the last class of the semester. We will also bring in 2-3 industry guest judges to provide feedback on projects.
