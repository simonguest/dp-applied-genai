# Applied Generative AI Course (DigiPen)

"Applied Generative AI" is a comprehensive 15-week course designed for computer science majors (BSCS, BSCSML, BSCSGD) , focusing on the fundamentals and practical applications of generative AI within the gaming industry.

Students will explore neural network architectures, including the impact of the Transformer model, delve into large language models beyond ChatGPT, and experiment with multimodal models for image and audio generation. The course offers hands-on experience with both hosted and locally run models, integration with game engines like Unity and Unreal, and the development of AI-driven game characters and environments. 

Ethical considerations and model evaluation are woven throughout the curriculum, ensuring students not only master technical skills but also understand the broader societal implications of their work. Through lectures, lab sessions, and a final project, students will gain the expertise to leverage generative AI in creating innovative, interactive gaming experiences.
