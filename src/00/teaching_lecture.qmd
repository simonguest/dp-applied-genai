## But We Discovered Limitations

::: {.incremental}
- **Not Proactive**: No ability to plan beyond a single interaction

- **Not Reactive**: Cannot respond to different conditions
- **No Memory**: Everything has to be replayed in the context window
- **No Interactivity**: Cannot reach out to other LLMs and external systems
